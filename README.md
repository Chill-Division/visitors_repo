# visitors_repo
Visitor sign-in repository for Home Assistant integration

A simple facility visitor sign in / out tracker

This is designed to allow visitors to quickly check in to your site, while not causing any issues if they don't sign out. We also wanted it to be quick and easy to sign out so there are no in-person traffic-jams from that taking place.

To install, simply go to Home Assistant Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on Store. Tap the 3-dot menu up the top-right, and choose "Repositories". Paste in the URL for this Repo, and click Add:
<pre>https://github.com/Chill-Division/visitors_repo</pre>

When configuring the add-on, you can set an administrative password that will keep access to the history private. You can tap on the padlock in the top-right hand corner of the sign-in screen to be taken to the admin portal and both view the login history as well as set the things the user must agree to when signing in.
